            "content": "Never saw the first one, nor played any of the games - but I still quite enjoyed this animated adventure. \"Sonic\" is determined to use his powers to be a crime fighting hero, but frequently causes more havoc than the criminals! When the dastardly \"Robotnik\" manages to escape from his prison in a galaxy far, far, way and returns with the echidna from hell (\"Knuckles\") though, our blue pal finds himself and his family in considerable peril. Luckily, help is on hand from the twin-tailed \"Tails\" and battle lines are drawn Who can find the giant emerald first? The story is pretty derivative - bits of \"Indiana Jones\"; \"National Treasure\" and even \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" all seem to have influenced the story, which I have to say is a little predictably thin. That said, it is well placed with plenty in the script for the grown ups amongst the audience. \"Sonic\" makes for quite a likeable rodent and Jim Carrey\"s engagingly hammy, moustachioed, megalomanic works well. The star? Well that's Natasha Rothwell's no-nonsense, would-be bride \"Rachel\" (a part of the storyline that doesn't work so well, but she is definitely not to be messed with). The visual effects are impressive and though maybe fifteen minutes too long, I still found it very much better than I had expected.",

            "content": "Sonic the Hedgehog 2 embraces the nostalgia of Sega Genesis and the essence of the 90s with a film that is fun for absolutely everyone of all ages. Audiences will adore the new characters, the action is a memorable throwback to what we loved about the games the films are based on, and the special effects are top notch. Even with its flaws, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the best video game adaptation ever.\r\n\r\nFull review: https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Sonic-the-Hedgehog-2-Review-2022-The-Master-Emerald-of-Family-Friendly-Entertainment",
